# Changelog

All notable changes to SkillsForge are recorded here.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Capability-engine integration on top of the marketplace architecture.
- Canonical `skillsforge.json` sidecar contract, deterministic forge, explainable routing, policy scanning, evidence receipts, and a self-contained runtime CLI.
- Skill-scoped Claude policy hooks compiled from declared capabilities.
- Holdout routing evaluation and cache-copy install smoke tests.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-11

### Changed

- Restructured as a multi-plugin marketplace; no action for installed users.
- Moved the existing validator plugin under `plugins/skillsforge` without changing its marketplace or skill names.
- Added repository-wide version lockstep checks and multi-plugin skill discovery.
- Embedded generated schemas in the standalone validator so installed plugins do not depend on repository source files.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- A working `validate-agent-skill` Claude Code skill.
- Portable Agent Skills and explicit Claude Code validation profiles.
- Real YAML parsing and Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema validation.
- Human-readable and JSON diagnostics with stable exit codes.
- A generated standalone validator command for dependency-free plugin installs.
- Cross-platform tests, strict Claude plugin validation, and bundle freshness checks.
- MIT licensing and accurate installation, architecture, safety, and usage documentation.

### Fixed

- Corrected the Claude Code plugin and marketplace manifest structures.
- Replaced prefix-based path checks with separator-aware and real-path containment.
- Added support for BOM, CRLF, comments, quoted values, and multiline YAML.
- Made an empty production skill library fail validation by default.

### Removed

- Placeholder commands, agents, hooks, adapters, routing, synchronization, forge, and orchestration modules that did not implement their advertised behavior.
